    model/user/user_type.php - the superclass for word, formula and view types
    ------------------------

    types are used to assign coded functionality to a word, formula or view
    a user can create a new type to group words, formulas or views and request new functionality for the group
    types can be renamed by a user and the user change the comment
    it should be possible to translate types on the fly
    on each program start the types are loaded once into an array, because they are not supposed to change during execution
