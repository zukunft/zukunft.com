    test/php/utils/all_tests.php - the main test object for all tests (unit, read, write, api, ui and connection)
    ----------------------------
    
    combines unit, read, write, api, ui and connection tests


    separated into:
    unit tests - test_units.php: for fast internal code consistency TESTing of the technical library functions without database connection
    db read tests - test_unit_db.php: for unit testing that only read from the database
    db write tests - test all processes that can be initiated by a user including database writing and database cleanup

    - target is to executes all class methods and all functions at least once
    - in case of errors in the methods automatically a ticket is opened the the table sys_log
    - with zukunft.com/error_update.php the tickets can be view and closed
    - and compares the result with the expected result
    - in case of an unexpected result also a ticket is created
    - check the correct setup of the base words, numbers and formulas
    - always synthetic reserved words and values are used for testing that are defined in each class and are removed after the tests

    TODO
    - move the tests to classes and call all tests with test.php but stop in case of an error
    - use for testing only data that is supposed never to be used by any user e.g. use "TestWord" instead of "Company"
    - before starting the system test, check that really no user has used any test name and if create a warning and stop the test
    - use YAML export and import for testing the base sets
    - check that the order of the view items cannot be changed by another user
    - add get_xxx functions for all objects and use them
    - send daily report at 07:00 CET and report all errors via email
    - add all missing class functions with at lease one test case
    - check that a object function never changes a parameter
    e.g. if a formula object is loaded the calculation of a result should not influence the loaded ref text
    instead use a copy of the ref text for the calculation
    - check the usage of "old" functions
