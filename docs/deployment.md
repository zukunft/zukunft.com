Deployment
----------

To fix a bug or add a feature to this project follow these steps

1. create an issue e.g. that should at least contain a definition of done (DoD)
2. create a branch for this issue that starts with "bigfix/" or "feature/" the issue number and the description e.g. "feature/72-system-views"
3. use this branch to do the code changes
4. make sure that all tests are running fine before the commit
5. request a review and if it is fine create a pull request to the development branch
6. once the change is in the development branch the [build process](build_process.md) will start the automatic full test and the deployment process towards production
